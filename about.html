				By day, Iâ€™m a UBC Computer Science student trying (desperately) to outsmart bugs, 
				deploy AWS Lambda functions and pray to the cloud gods they work in prod, 
				and survive on an unhealthy amount of caffeine and vibesâ„¢. 
				By night, Iâ€™m... still that, but now Iâ€™m also making websites like this one, 
				knitting scarves, hiking in the rain, or impulse-getting piercings (current count: 8).

				Iâ€™m obsessed with building things - web apps, silly Spotify playlists, 
				snowmen, life plans, you name it. I dream of one day getting a paragliding license, 
				going glacier hiking, launching a YouTube music channel, and maybe (maybe!) getting a tattoo 
				that doesnâ€™t make me panic the next day.

				This blog is part memory book, part proof that I exist and am doing things.

				podcasting, or eating hotpot while questioning if free will is an illusion :0
